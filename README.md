# Covid-19 test upload system

This system has been proposed to Eastern Mediterranean University for evaluation of the Covid-19 test. The system is working only for those who had done a Covid-19 Test at Turkish Republc of Northern Cyprus.

# How the system works?
The system requires users to be logged in. At the database of the system Passport number/National ID is saved. This data is required for the evaluation process. After logging in the user has the option to upload a new test. 

At upload a new test page, user can see the latest test information and another section for uploading the barcode of the new test. When the user enters the barcode and clicks on the submit button, the process of evaluation is going to start and related message is going to be displayed to the user.
